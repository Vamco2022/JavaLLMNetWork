# Java LLM NetWork

This is a java project what the LLM network, The all are the source code file, write by me. But I should overwrite it, so you only see a old file "AND_Network.java" in here now.(Has bugs and not finish)

# Why the project must overwrite?

The old file is write on Oct. 2023, then I relax long time not to write it, so I forgot the all code means of the old main file, I must overwirte it.

# When am I overwirte it finish?

Maybe between the May. 2024 and Oct. 2024, Because I need study the LLM again.

It's New Year now, I have to relax, So now I'm not do it.
